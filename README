A simple kernel driver for the RXB6 RF receiver

The driver creates a character device /dev/rxb6 that returns one line per
detected pulse or a marker line. Every line is prefixed by a timestamp
(microseconds since boot).

Markers are:
  SYNC:      A sync pulse is detected.
  ERR_LEN:   The detected pulse is too short.
  ERR_LEVEL: The level of the pulse didn't toogle (missed pulse).
  END:       An end pulse is detected.

A pulse line contains the level (0 or 1) of the detected pulse followed by its
length in microseconds.

The driver starts returning data once a sync pulse is detected and until an end
pulse or an error condition is encountered.

A typical sequence looks like the following:
